# BThwani Agent Routing Index

Status: DERIVED_SUPPORT
Authority: `AGENTS.md`, `governance/authority/authority-precedence.json`, and `governance/skills/skills-registry.json`

## Purpose

Route repository work to the smallest sufficient set of active or conditional governed skills without duplicating policy, treating tools as authorities, or reviving retired legacy skills.

## Execution tiers

| Tier | Use when | Default routing |
|---|---|---|
| Instant | isolated wording, explanation, or one-line safe fix | no owner skill unless repository truth is claimed |
| Focused | one module or one owner boundary | workspace authority plus one applicable owner skill |
| Standard | multi-file or cross-layer work | workspace authority, task router, applicable owner skills, targeted evidence |
| Escalated | product, finance, security, governance, CI, migration, release, or formal closure | formal authorities, SDLC routing, independent evidence |

LeanCTX, Graphify, and Nx are optional tools. They are never mandatory first steps and never own approval.

## Mandatory routing

- Repository, branch, commit, PR, remote state, or write → `bthwani-current-workspace-authority`.
- Task mode, risk, ownership, or scope ambiguity → `bthwani-universal-task-router`.
- Evidence-scope selection → `bthwani-evidence-gate-router`.
- Agent, skill, adapter, registry, or routing changes → `bthwani-agent-skill-integrity`.
- Guard selection or command resolution → `bthwani-guard-command-router`.
- Governance, gate, local action, or GitHub workflow changes → `bthwani-governance-ci-guardian`.
- User-visible, role-sensitive, cross-surface, commercial, or workflow changes → `bthwani-product-truth-governor`.
- API, route, generated client, or consumer binding → `bthwani-api-runtime-binding`.
- Route, screen, state, action, or controller binding → `bthwani-screen-flow-binding`.
- Cross-layer service capability → `bthwani-service-fullstack-journey`.
- DSH/WLT financial truth or handoff → `bthwani-dsh-wlt-finance-boundary`.
- Runtime configuration or provider posture → `bthwani-platform-runtime-config`.
- Docker, data-plane, persistence, or live behavior evidence → `bthwani-docker-journey-runtime`.
- Auth, authorization, sessions, secrets, PII, privacy, CORS, or sensitive configuration → `bthwani-security-secrets-privacy`.
- Formal G0–G10 lifecycle control → `bthwani-sdlc-stage-gate-orchestrator`.
- Final multi-scope closure → `bthwani-final-journey-closure-judge`.
- Two or more independent bounded work units with real subagent capability → `bthwani-cost-aware-subagent-orchestrator`.

## Product routing order

```text
Problem and evidence
→ actors and role boundaries
→ required and excluded surfaces
→ observable outcome and acceptance
→ Product Manager approval
→ Product Owner implementation-readiness approval
→ architecture and contracts
→ implementation
→ product acceptance
→ independent governance, CI, QA, security, release, and production evidence as applicable
```

Implementation skills may not bypass Product Truth or formal authorities.

## Governed skills

### Always active

- `bthwani-current-workspace-authority`
- `bthwani-universal-task-router`
- `bthwani-evidence-gate-router`

### Conditional owner and routing skills

- `bthwani-agent-skill-integrity`
- `bthwani-guard-command-router`
- `bthwani-governance-ci-guardian`
- `bthwani-product-truth-governor`
- `bthwani-api-runtime-binding`
- `bthwani-screen-flow-binding`
- `bthwani-service-fullstack-journey`
- `bthwani-dsh-wlt-finance-boundary`
- `bthwani-platform-runtime-config`
- `bthwani-docker-journey-runtime`
- `bthwani-security-secrets-privacy`
- `bthwani-sdlc-stage-gate-orchestrator`
- `bthwani-final-journey-closure-judge`
- `bthwani-cost-aware-subagent-orchestrator`

## Retired skills

The canonical retired set exists only in `governance/skills/skills-registry.json`. Retired skills:

- may remain as historical/reference files;
- may not be selected by routing;
- may not own authority or approval;
- may not be dependencies of active or conditional skills;
- may not be described as active, default, mandatory, or current truth.

## Tool ladder

1. Direct scoped repository inspection.
2. Existing targeted search, script, or registered guard.
3. Small idempotent helper for a repeated narrow pattern.
4. LeanCTX only when active and materially more efficient.
5. Graphify only for unclear ownership, routing, dependency, duplication, or dead-code relationships.
6. Nx affected only when workspace impact calculation is required.
7. Runtime tools only when runtime behavior is changed or claimed.

## Skill ownership rules

- Load only the active or conditional governed skills required by the task.
- Owner skills govern only their declared authority domain.
- Coordinators orchestrate but do not duplicate specialist policy or formal approval.
- Adapters and tools own no approval.
- Every dependency must resolve to an active or conditional governed skill.
- Every decision maps through `governance/contracts/decision-vocabulary.json`.
- A scoped `PASS` cannot be upgraded to `CLOSED_WITH_EVIDENCE`.

## Acceptance condition

Accepted only when routing matches the skill registry, all selected skills are governed and non-retired, Product Truth precedes implementation where applicable, G0–G10 terminology is consistent, optional tools remain optional, dependencies resolve without cycles, and no adapter, tool, executor, or retired skill can self-grant formal approval.
